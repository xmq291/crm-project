# crm-project: Building RESTful API with Node.js and Express. 
In this course, Emmanuel Henri shows how to create a simple, RESTful web API with these two popular JavaScript libraries. He shows how to set up the project, including the Express server and testing environment, and create the endpoints needed to add, update, and delete data from a MongoDB database. At the end of the course, he shows how to serve static files such as images with your new API, and explores additional libraries that can help streamline API development, such as Koa and LoopBack.
