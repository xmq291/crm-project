### Followed from LinkedIn Learning course: Building RESTful API with
Node.js and Express. In this course, Emmanuel Henri shows how to create
a simple, RESTful web API with these two popular JavaScript libraries.
He shows how to set up the project, including the Express server and
testing environment, and create the endpoints needed to add, update,
and delete data from a MongoDB database. At the end of the course, he
shows how to serve static files such as images with your new API, and
explores additional libraries that can help streamline API development,
such as Koa and LoopBack.
